## SmrithiVault ‚Äì Digital Identity & Document Verification

**Team OpenSmrithi**

SmrithiVault is a blockchain-based platform for secure digital identity and document verification.  
It addresses the inefficiencies of centralized identity systems and enables user-controlled data sharing.  
Documents are uploaded to IPFS, and their hashes are stored on the blockchain for tamper-proof integrity.  
Users can control what data verifiers see and generate offline-verifiable QR codes.  
AI extracts document content and detects fraud through anomaly detection techniques.  
Verifiers scan QR or DID to verify identity without needing full data exposure.  
The system aligns with Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) principles and UN SDG 16.  
Built using React, Node.js, IPFS, Polygon, Solidity, and Python ML models.  
SmrithiVault ensures privacy, security, and accessibility‚Äîonline or offline.
